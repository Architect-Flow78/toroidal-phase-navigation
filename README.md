# Toroidal Phase Navigation Engine

A phase-based navigation engine using toroidal geometry (π = 1) to
predict stable trajectories and null gravitational zones.

This project models motion not as force interaction,
but as movement through phase-stable channels.

## Features
- Toroidal phase space (θ, φ, s)
- Phase tension instead of gravity
- Null zone detection
- Forward trajectory prediction
- Streamlit visualization

## Run demo
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
